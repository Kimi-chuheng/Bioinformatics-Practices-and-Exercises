  - Sequence length: 199 amino acids
1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - S: 24 (12.06%)
  - K: 20 (10.05%)
  - T: 17 (8.54%)
  - N: 17 (8.54%)
  - I: 15 (7.53%)
  - L: 14 (7.03%)
  - V: 13 (6.53%)
  - G: 11 (5.52%)
  - E: 11 (5.52%)
  - P: 10 (5.02%)
  - Y: 9 (4.52%)
  - D: 8 (4.02%)
  - F: 7 (3.51%)
  - C: 7 (3.51%)
  - A: 5 (2.51%)
  - Q: 4 (2.01%)
  - H: 3 (1.50%)
  - R: 2 (1.00%)
  - M: 2 (1.00%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 23
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Shallow alignment (5-50 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Moderate number of homologs found (23)
  - Structure prediction likely to have reasonable accuracy

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
