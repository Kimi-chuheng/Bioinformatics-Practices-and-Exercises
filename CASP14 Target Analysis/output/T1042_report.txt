====================================================
Generated on: Tue May 13 15:33:13 CDT 2025

--------- 1. TARGET SEQUENCE ANALYSIS ---------
1.1 Basic Sequence Information:
  - Sequence length: 289 amino acids
1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - N: 33 (11.41%)
  - L: 28 (9.68%)
  - K: 27 (9.34%)
  - S: 26 (8.99%)
  - I: 22 (7.61%)
  - D: 22 (7.61%)
  - F: 18 (6.22%)
  - E: 17 (5.88%)
  - G: 14 (4.84%)
  - Y: 13 (4.49%)
  - T: 13 (4.49%)
  - V: 12 (4.15%)
  - Q: 11 (3.80%)
  - M: 9 (3.11%)
  - R: 7 (2.42%)
  - P: 7 (2.42%)
  - A: 6 (2.07%)
  - H: 2 (.69%)
  - W: 1 (.34%)
  - C: 1 (.34%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 1
  - WARNING: MSA has only the query sequence - poor alignment
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - No aligned sequences found other than the query

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - LOW CONFIDENCE: Few homologous sequences found (1)
  - Structure prediction may be challenging
  - Consider additional search methods or experimental approaches

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
