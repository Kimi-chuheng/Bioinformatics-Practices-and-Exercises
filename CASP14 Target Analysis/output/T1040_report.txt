--------- 1. TARGET SEQUENCE ANALYSIS ---------
1.1 Basic Sequence Information:
  - Sequence length: 130 amino acids
1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - E: 16 (12.30%)
  - N: 13 (10.00%)
  - L: 11 (8.46%)
  - K: 11 (8.46%)
  - I: 11 (8.46%)
  - D: 10 (7.69%)
  - T: 7 (5.38%)
  - F: 7 (5.38%)
  - A: 7 (5.38%)
  - Y: 6 (4.61%)
  - V: 6 (4.61%)
  - S: 6 (4.61%)
  - H: 6 (4.61%)
  - Q: 4 (3.07%)
  - G: 4 (3.07%)
  - P: 2 (1.53%)
  - W: 1 (.76%)
  - R: 1 (.76%)
  - M: 1 (.76%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 1
  - WARNING: MSA has only the query sequence - poor alignment
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - No aligned sequences found other than the query

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - LOW CONFIDENCE: Few homologous sequences found (1)
  - Structure prediction may be challenging
  - Consider additional search methods or experimental approaches

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
