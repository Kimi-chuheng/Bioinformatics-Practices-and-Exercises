1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - K: 53 (11.42%)
  - I: 53 (11.42%)
  - L: 50 (10.77%)
  - N: 44 (9.48%)
  - D: 37 (7.97%)
  - E: 32 (6.89%)
  - S: 31 (6.68%)
  - Y: 29 (6.25%)
  - V: 26 (5.60%)
  - F: 20 (4.31%)
  - M: 15 (3.23%)
  - T: 13 (2.80%)
  - R: 13 (2.80%)
  - A: 12 (2.58%)
  - Q: 10 (2.15%)
  - P: 7 (1.50%)
  - G: 7 (1.50%)
  - C: 6 (1.29%)
  - H: 5 (1.07%)
  - W: 1 (.21%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 12
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Shallow alignment (5-50 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Moderate number of homologs found (12)
  - Structure prediction likely to have reasonable accuracy

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
