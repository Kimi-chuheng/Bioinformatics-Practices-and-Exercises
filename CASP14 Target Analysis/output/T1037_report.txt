1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - N: 39 (9.65%)
  - S: 35 (8.66%)
  - T: 33 (8.16%)
  - K: 33 (8.16%)
  - L: 32 (7.92%)
  - I: 29 (7.17%)
  - D: 26 (6.43%)
  - G: 25 (6.18%)
  - E: 25 (6.18%)
  - V: 22 (5.44%)
  - F: 22 (5.44%)
  - A: 17 (4.20%)
  - Q: 14 (3.46%)
  - Y: 13 (3.21%)
  - R: 12 (2.97%)
  - H: 10 (2.47%)
  - P: 9 (2.22%)
  - M: 6 (1.48%)
  - W: 2 (.49%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 12
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Shallow alignment (5-50 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Moderate number of homologs found (12)
  - Structure prediction likely to have reasonable accuracy

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
