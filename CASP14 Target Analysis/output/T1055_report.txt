  - K: 13 (8.78%)
  - E: 12 (8.10%)
  - V: 11 (7.43%)
  - I: 11 (7.43%)
  - G: 11 (7.43%)
  - L: 10 (6.75%)
  - F: 10 (6.75%)
  - S: 9 (6.08%)
  - T: 7 (4.72%)
  - D: 7 (4.72%)
  - A: 6 (4.05%)
  - R: 5 (3.37%)
  - Q: 4 (2.70%)
  - C: 4 (2.70%)
  - Y: 3 (2.02%)
  - P: 2 (1.35%)
  - W: 1 (.67%)
  - M: 1 (.67%)
  - H: 1 (.67%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 30
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Shallow alignment (5-50 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Moderate number of homologs found (30)
  - Structure prediction likely to have reasonable accuracy

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
