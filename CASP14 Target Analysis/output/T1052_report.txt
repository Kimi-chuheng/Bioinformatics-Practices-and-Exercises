  - M: 12 (1.44%)
  - W: 11 (1.32%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 4105
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Deep alignment (>500 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - HIGH CONFIDENCE: Many homologous sequences found (4105)
  - Structure prediction likely to be accurate

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Proceed with folding using AlphaFold2 or RoseTTAFold
  - Expected good quality prediction based on alignment depth
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
