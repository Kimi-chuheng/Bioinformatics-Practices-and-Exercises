1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - K: 38 (13.91%)
  - L: 26 (9.52%)
  - S: 24 (8.79%)
  - Q: 22 (8.05%)
  - A: 22 (8.05%)
  - E: 21 (7.69%)
  - N: 19 (6.95%)
  - I: 16 (5.86%)
  - V: 15 (5.49%)
  - D: 15 (5.49%)
  - T: 13 (4.76%)
  - G: 11 (4.02%)
  - R: 9 (3.29%)
  - Y: 8 (2.93%)
  - F: 5 (1.83%)
  - M: 4 (1.46%)
  - P: 3 (1.09%)
  - W: 1 (.36%)
  - H: 1 (.36%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 26
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Shallow alignment (5-50 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Moderate number of homologs found (26)
  - Structure prediction likely to have reasonable accuracy

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
