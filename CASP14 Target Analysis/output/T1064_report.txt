Generated on: Tue May 13 15:33:13 CDT 2025

--------- 1. TARGET SEQUENCE ANALYSIS ---------
1.1 Basic Sequence Information:
  - Sequence length: 106 amino acids
1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - V: 10 (9.43%)
  - S: 9 (8.49%)
  - L: 8 (7.54%)
  - I: 8 (7.54%)
  - Y: 7 (6.60%)
  - P: 7 (6.60%)
  - D: 7 (6.60%)
  - C: 7 (6.60%)
  - Q: 6 (5.66%)
  - F: 6 (5.66%)
  - E: 6 (5.66%)
  - R: 4 (3.77%)
  - K: 4 (3.77%)
  - H: 4 (3.77%)
  - G: 4 (3.77%)
  - T: 3 (2.83%)
  - A: 3 (2.83%)
  - N: 2 (1.88%)
  - W: 1 (.94%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 9
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Shallow alignment (5-50 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - LOW CONFIDENCE: Few homologous sequences found (9)
  - Structure prediction may be challenging
  - Consider additional search methods or experimental approaches

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
