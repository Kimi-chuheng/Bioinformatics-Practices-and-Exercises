1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - R: 19 (9.00%)
  - L: 18 (8.53%)
  - V: 16 (7.58%)
  - Q: 16 (7.58%)
  - P: 14 (6.63%)
  - K: 12 (5.68%)
  - Y: 11 (5.21%)
  - G: 11 (5.21%)
  - E: 11 (5.21%)
  - D: 11 (5.21%)
  - A: 11 (5.21%)
  - T: 10 (4.73%)
  - S: 9 (4.26%)
  - M: 9 (4.26%)
  - H: 9 (4.26%)
  - F: 8 (3.79%)
  - N: 5 (2.36%)
  - I: 4 (1.89%)
  - C: 4 (1.89%)
  - W: 3 (1.42%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 32
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Shallow alignment (5-50 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Moderate number of homologs found (32)
  - Structure prediction likely to have reasonable accuracy

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
