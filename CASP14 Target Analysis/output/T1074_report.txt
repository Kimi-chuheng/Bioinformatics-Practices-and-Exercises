Generated on: Tue May 13 15:33:12 CDT 2025

--------- 1. TARGET SEQUENCE ANALYSIS ---------
1.1 Basic Sequence Information:
  - Sequence length: 202 amino acids
1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - G: 25 (12.37%)
  - L: 22 (10.89%)
  - S: 17 (8.41%)
  - K: 17 (8.41%)
  - T: 14 (6.93%)
  - D: 13 (6.43%)
  - V: 12 (5.94%)
  - R: 11 (5.44%)
  - F: 11 (5.44%)
  - A: 11 (5.44%)
  - E: 9 (4.45%)
  - Y: 6 (2.97%)
  - Q: 6 (2.97%)
  - N: 6 (2.97%)
  - M: 6 (2.97%)
  - P: 5 (2.47%)
  - I: 5 (2.47%)
  - C: 4 (1.98%)
  - W: 1 (.49%)
  - H: 1 (.49%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 7
  - MSA has multiple sequences - good for structure prediction
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - Alignment depth assessment: based on sequence count
    * Shallow alignment (5-50 sequences)

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - LOW CONFIDENCE: Few homologous sequences found (7)
  - Structure prediction may be challenging
  - Consider additional search methods or experimental approaches

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
