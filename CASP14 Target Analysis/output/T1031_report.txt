Generated on: Tue May 13 15:33:12 CDT 2025

--------- 1. TARGET SEQUENCE ANALYSIS ---------
1.1 Basic Sequence Information:
  - Sequence length: 95 amino acids
1.2 Amino Acid Composition:
  - E: 11 (11.57%)
  - K: 10 (10.52%)
  - D: 10 (10.52%)
  - L: 9 (9.47%)
  - I: 8 (8.42%)
  - S: 6 (6.31%)
  - N: 6 (6.31%)
  - F: 6 (6.31%)
  - R: 5 (5.26%)
  - G: 5 (5.26%)
  - V: 4 (4.21%)
  - Y: 3 (3.15%)
  - Q: 3 (3.15%)
  - A: 3 (3.15%)
  - P: 2 (2.10%)
  - W: 1 (1.05%)
  - T: 1 (1.05%)
  - H: 1 (1.05%)
  - C: 1 (1.05%)
1.3 No non-standard amino acids detected.
1.4 Prediction Information:
  - PSIPRED not found. Secondary structure prediction skipped.

--------- 2. MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS ---------
2.1 MSA Statistics:
  - Number of sequences in alignment: 1
  - WARNING: MSA has only the query sequence - poor alignment
2.2 Alignment Coverage Analysis:
  - No aligned sequences found other than the query

--------- 3. STRUCTURE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ---------
3.1 Prediction Confidence Estimate:
  - LOW CONFIDENCE: Few homologous sequences found (1)
  - Structure prediction may be challenging
  - Consider additional search methods or experimental approaches

--------- 4. RECOMMENDATIONS ---------
4.1 Next Steps:
  - Try deeper sequence search (more iterations, different databases)
  - Consider using AlphaFold2 with templates
4.2 Additional Analyses to Consider:
  - Conserved domain search (NCBI CDD, Pfam)
  - Transmembrane region prediction
  - Signal peptide prediction
  - Disorder prediction
